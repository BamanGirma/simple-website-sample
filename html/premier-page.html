        <p class="desc">The African kingdom of Axum (also Aksum) was located on the northern edge of the highland 0n mbzone of the Red Sea coast, just above the horn of Africa. It was founded in the 1st century CE, flourished from the 3rd to 6th century CE, and then survived as a much smaller political entity into the 8th century CE.
        The territory Axum once controlled is today occupied by the states of Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia, and Somaliland. Prospering thanks to agriculture, cattle herding, and control over trade routes which saw gold and ivory exchanged for foreign luxury goods, the kingdom and its capital of Axum built lasting stone monuments and achieved a number of firsts.
        Several stelae survive in the town of Aksum dating between the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. The largest standing obelisk rises to a height of over 23 meters and is exquisitely carved to represent a nine-storey building of the Aksumites. It stands at the entrance of the main stelae area. The largest obelisk of some 33 meters long lies where it fell, perhaps during the process of erection. It is possibly the largest monolithic stele  that ancient human beings ever attempted to erect.

        <p class="desc">Gonder, also spelled Gondar, city, northwestern Ethiopia. It stands at an elevation of 7,500 feet (2,300 metres) on a basaltic ridge from which streams flanking the town flow to Lake Tana, 21 miles (34 km) south.
        Gonder was the capital of Ethiopia from 1632 to 1855, and it has the remains of castles and palaces constructed by a series of emperors from Fasilides (reigned 1632–67) to Iyasu II (1730–55).
        Tourist destination of gonder
        Between the thirteenth and seventeenth centuries, Ethiopian rulers moved their royal camps frequently. King Fasil (Fasilidas) settled in Gondar and established it as a permanent capital in 1636. Before its decline in the late eighteenth century, the royal court had developed from a camp into a fortified compound called Fasil Ghebbi, consisting of six major building complexes and other ancillary buildings, surrounded by a wall 900 metres long, with twelve entrances and three bridges.

        <p class="desc">The Palace is the oldest, largest, and best-preserved surviving example of traditional wooden architecture in Jimma. It is a fusion of traditional building technology from south-western Ethiopia and the Indo-Arab architectural style, which was common in settlements around the Indian Ocean. There are strong stylistic parallels between architectural features at the Palace and Indian mercantile architecture found in Zanzibar and along the mainland coast of East Africa. Other wooden buildings in Addis Ababa and elsewhere in Ethiopia were built in the Indo-Arab style, but none combined this style with traditional southern-Ethiopian building traditions. The Palace is an important indicator of cultural and mercantile links between the highlands of Ethiopia and the outside world. The impressive palace of Aba Jifar II is found at Jiren about 8 km from the center of Jimma city was built at the cost of 400 kg of Gold and 65000 Maria Theressa Dollars towards the end of 1860s. The palace stands with colorful architectural beauty. In the compound of the palace still stand other four buildings: the public mosque, the mosque of Abba Jifar, the residential palace of Aba Jifar, the residential palace of Aba Jobir, and Aba Dula (the grandson of Aba Jifar). Nowadays, the palace is in the renewal process since 2019 with the aid of the American government.

            This fascinating wall once had five gates: Shoa Gate, Buda Gate, Sanga Gate, Erer Gate and Fallana Gate, each providing five pathways into five different quarters of the city. 
            Still intact, the Jugol wall has become an icon of the city. Feed some Hyenas Harar is most famous for its Hyena Man. Feeding hyenas is actually a thing in this part of town. It all started in the 20th century when the Harari people started feeding the local hyenas to stop them from decimating their livestock. Consequently, these large, grizzled hyenas stopped searching for their own food and started coming into the city to get their red meat from the local hyena man.Believed to have hosted the honeymoon of Haile Selassie and his wife Menen Asfaw, the Sherif Harar city museum is filled with jewellery, coins, weaponry, textiles and old manuscripts collected from across the region, including Amhara, Gurage, Oromo, Somali and Argoba.

        After dinner at Dodom you begin the trek to the crater rim at around 7PM. While the sun may disappear behind the horizon, the heat of the Danakil lingers and the trek shouldn’t be underestimated. After 3-4 hours, you reach the summit.

Roha, capital of the Zagwe dynasty for about 300 years, was renamed for its most distinguished monarch, Lalībela (late 12th–early 13th century), who, according to tradition, built the 11 monolithic churches for which the place is famous. The churches, designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1978, were hewn out of solid rock (entirely below ground level) in a variety of styles. Generally, trenches were excavated in a rectangle, isolating a solid granite block.
